ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest Project: Job Application Tracker! ðŸš€

Iâ€™ve been working hard on Job Application Tracker, an application designed to help users manage and track their job applications seamlessly.

Homepage: A brief overview of the application.
Login: Simple and secure access.
Dashboard: A user-friendly interface for managing applications.
Adding Applications: Easily add and organize job applications.
Viewing Applications: Quick access to view application details.
Deleting Applications: Streamlined process to remove applications.
Logout: Securely exit the application.

ðŸŒŸ Technologies Used:
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Templating: EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)
Database: PostgreSQL
Other Libraries: bcrypt, jsonwebtoken, nodemailer, and more.
This project has been an incredible learning opportunity, allowing me to enhance my skills in building RESTful APIs, working with databases, and server-side rendering with EJS.

Iâ€™d love to hear your feedback and insights, and Iâ€™m looking forward to connecting with other developers and recruiters interested in backend development! Thank you for taking the time to check it out! ðŸ™Œ
